# AdventOfCode2024

This is just a little thing I thought would be fun to partake in with some PSAS people. :)

## Day 1

Today was super easy, yet was still very fun to participate in. I'm pretty positive I could have done this no problem if I didn't think about it at work today, but I got bored and Python/VS Code were installed on my laptop, so... Not going to lie, despite that being super easy, I am a little concerned of what something like day 5 or day 10 is going to bring if the Primeagen is to be believed (mentioned that's how far you could probably get with bash but idk anything really). I am also a little nervous to go against Max (from PSAS) because he is super smart, and [very] likely to know a lot more than me, if not in Python, than definitely whichever language he's most familiar with (either Python or C/C++). We'll see what the future holds... Excited for more, terrified of my competition.

## Day 3

I was not excited for this one because I read the challenge and knew straight away that I would need to use regex (which up until that point I had never used before). After fiddling with it for a little bit and using an online parser to help me out a lot, I somehow managed to get it to work in the way that I wanted and completed the first puzzle with like 45 minutes to spare! Never thought I would've used it successfully, but here we are with a silver star for the day. After reading puzzle 2 with my leftover time, I gave up because I knew that I would not have gotten 2 stars before my time ran out. And as I predicted, the other folks were well ahead of me since I have significantly less time to work on these puzzles.
