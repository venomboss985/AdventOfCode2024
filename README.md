# AdventOfCode2024

This is just a little thing I thought would be fun to partake in with some PSAS people. :)

## Day 1:

Today was super easy, yet was still very fun to participate in. I'm pretty positive I could have done this no problem if I didn't think about it at work today, but I got bored and Python/VS Code were installed on my laptop, so... Not going to lie, despite that being super easy, I am a little concerned of what something like day 5 or day 10 is going to bring if the Primeagen is to be believed (mentioned that's how far you could probably get with bash but idk anything really). I am also a little nervous to go against Max (from PSAS) because he is super smart, and [very] likely to know a lot more than me, if not in Python, than definitely whichever language he's most familiar with (either Python or C/C++). We'll see what the future holds... Excited for more, terrified of my competition.
