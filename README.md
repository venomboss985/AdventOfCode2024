# AdventOfCode2024

This is just a little thing I thought would be fun to partake in with some PSAS people. :)

## Day 1

Today was super easy, yet was still very fun to participate in. I'm pretty positive I could have done this no problem if I didn't think about it at work today, but I got bored and Python/VS Code were installed on my laptop, so... Not going to lie, despite that being super easy, I am a little concerned of what something like day 5 or day 10 is going to bring if the Primeagen is to be believed (mentioned that's how far you could probably get with bash but idk anything really). I am also a little nervous to go against Max (from PSAS) because he is super smart, and [very] likely to know a lot more than me, if not in Python, than definitely whichever language he's most familiar with (either Python or C/C++). We'll see what the future holds... Excited for more, terrified of my competition.

## Day 3

I was not excited for this one because I read the challenge and knew straight away that I would need to use regex (which up until that point I had never used before). After fiddling with it for a little bit and using an online parser to help me out a lot, I somehow managed to get it to work in the way that I wanted and completed the first puzzle with like 45 minutes to spare! Never thought I would've used it successfully, but here we are with a silver star for the day. After reading puzzle 2 with my leftover time, I gave up because I knew that I would not have gotten 2 stars before my time ran out. And as I predicted, the other folks were well ahead of me since I have significantly less time to work on these puzzles.

## Day 5

I went into this one thinking it was going to be relatively straight forward, alas I was wrong. The thing that was tripping me up the most was figuring out how to check and compare the indices of each number that was in the list. For whatever reason, it took me like 2 hours to realize "Oh, I should probably just go from left to right and check if the currently read number is in the 'comes after this' lists and reject it if it's not". Suffice to say, I was pretty stoked when I got it. Though checking the second puzzle doesn't sound too much more difficult than the first one since it sounds like it's just a recursive sort? I'm probably wrong on that, but if I have more time today (which I likely won't), I'll give it a shot and see if I get it.
